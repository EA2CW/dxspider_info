Create a secure connection between nodes
****************************************

In order to avoid possible impersonation, it is necessary that connections between neighbouring nodes are made with authentication.

The steps to follow are

	1. Register node
	2. Assign password to the node
	3. Set node type
	
Although it is not necessary for both nodes to have authentication enabled, it is desirable.

The following is an example of how it is implemented at one endpoint

Scenario

	Node-A: XX0XX-2                    Node-B: ZZ8ZZ-4
	password para ZZ8ZZ-4: A49=Dk4T    password para XX0XX-2: jTra691R
	node-a.hams.org                    node-b.radio.com
	port 7300                          port 8000
	
Operation in Node-A (XX0XX-2)

	set/register ZZ8ZZ-4
	set/password ZZ8ZZ-4 A49=Dk4T
	set/spider ZZ8ZZ-4
	
Check if the process has been correct

	stat/user ZZ8ZZ-4
	
	Believable nodes: ZZ8ZZ-4
			 Buddies:
			Callsign: ZZ8ZZ-4
		 Connections: 16Feb2023@10:56:01=0s(5.78.40.70),
			   Group: local
		   Home Node: ZZ8ZZ-4
			Language: en
		   Last Node: XX0XX-2
		Last Ping at: XX0XX-2=16Feb2023@15:44:49
		   Last Seen: 16-Feb-2023 1544Z
		Last Time in: 16-Feb-2023 1219Z
		 Locked out?: No
			Password: Yes
	 Privilege Level: 1
		 Registered?: Yes
	  Seen on PC92 K: Yes
		  Start Time: 16-Feb-2023 1227Z
		Type of User: S

On the Node-B (ZZ8ZZ-4) should create a connection script similar to this one

	/spider/connect/XX0XX-2
	
	timeout 15
	connect telnet node-a.hams.org 7300
	'ogin: ' 'ZZ8ZZ-4'
	'assword:' 'A49=Dk4T'
	client XX0XX-2 telnet
	
Tested its operation on the Node-B (ZZ8ZZ-4) from console

	conn XX0XX-2
	
Check

	sh/conn XX0XX-2
	
	Cnum Call      Address/Port              State  Type   Dir.     Module
	  19 XX0XX-2   100.0.2.55/33074              C  telnet Outgoing ExtMsg
