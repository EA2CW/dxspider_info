List of nodes for mobile use
****************************

Displays a list of connected nodes reporting:

	Type of NODE
	And the duration of the connection
	
This command has been created to be used from a mobile app. It is possible to use it from a terminal or from console.

It may be necessary to install the Date:Manip module.

	# Debian or similar
	apt install libdate-manip-perl
	
or

	# Alternative
	cpanm install Date:Manip
	
The script is called mnode.pl

Using the sysop user, it has to be copied to:

	/spider/local_cmd
	
To run it use

	mnode
	
or

	mn
	
The output would look something like this example:

List of connected Nodes:

	Callsign  R P  Type       Connection Time
